# Re-Project
Re:Legen mods and other stuff will be followed here.


I have no Idea what I am doing but basically I will post mods here. Still don't know
how to use GitHub but that's just something that I will learn as I go :3


Now I am learning to do branches and commits because if you commit a crime you have
to pay for it right? well not in this universe. Apparently you can have 2 alternate
branches of the same universe with their own rules, kinda like steins;gate.
